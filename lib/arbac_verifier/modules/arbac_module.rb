  # Public: Parse a given and properly formatted arbac file into an easily usable hash
  #
  # path - The absolute path of the file that needs to be parsed
  #
  # Returns an hash representing the policy in the following format:
  #         :Roles - set of strings, the available roles in the policy
  #         :Users - set of strings, the users present in the policy
  #         :UA    - set of arrays of (2) strings, the first string of each inner array represents the user, the second the role that the user has
  #         :UR    - set of arrays of (2) strings, the first string of each inner array represents the role in power of revoke, the second the role to be revoked
  #         :CA    - set of arrays of (3) mixed where the first element is a string representing the role in power of assign; the second element is an array of two sets of strings,
  #                  representing respectively the positive preconditions and the negative ones needed to apply the assignment; the third element is a string representing the role to be assigned
  #         :Goal  - string, representing the role object of the reachability analysis for the given policy
